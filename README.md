## 🎯 Data Scientist |🧠 Aspiring Quant | 💹 Finance Nerd | 🐸 Frog With a Plan

Welcome to my pond!

I'm MadFroggie — a high-energy, high-variance, low-latency frog leaping headfirst into the world of quantitative finance. I live in the wild intersection of **data science**, **finance**, and **questionable sleep schedules**.

### 🐸 Fun Facts:

- 🟢 Looks like a meme, trains like a machine.
- 📉 Can explain a loss function *and* why frogs never take L’s.
- 🧪 Runs A/B tests on which bugs taste better.
- 🐍 Talks Python, thinks in NumPy, dreams in stochastic calculus.


### 🎯 Currently Jumping Into:
- Building trading bots that may or may not have a personality crisis
- Playing with volatility models like they’re LEGO
- Convincing my frog brain that linear algebra is actually fun

---

### ✨ Frog Goals:
- Leap into a quant analyst role
- Build models that don’t explode (on day one)
- Stay green, stay curious, and keep ribbiting

🐸 MadFroggie | Quant-in-Training | Certified Data Jumper
Hi, I'm MadFroggie — part frog, part data nerd, full-time chaos in the world of finance. 🐸💸

I'm an aspiring quant analyst who hops from one project to another like a caffeinated tree frog with a Wi-Fi connection. I live for number crunching, model building, and pretending spreadsheets are my natural habitat. If it involves data, finance, and some light mathematical wizardry — I’m probably already three jumps ahead of it.

Despite my permanently surprised expression and tendency to stare blankly at complex equations for hours, I swear I know what I’m doing. (Eventually.)

🟢 Favorite color? Green.
📈 Favorite activity? Jumping to conclusions with a linear regression.
🧠 Life motto? Might look goofy, but I leap high.

### 💬 Random Ribbit Jokes:

> 🐸 *"Why did the quant cross the road?"*  
> *To arbitrage both sides of the street.*  

> 🐸 *"My love life is like a failed backtest — overfit and underperforming."*

> 🐸 *"I tried to model my emotions... turns out they were non-stationary."*

> 🐸 *"The p-value said no... but I leapt anyway."*
